# Concepts

### Roles

We use multiple roles in today's applications to realize the requirement of different user groups with different set of rights. As an easy example you might think of normal users of your e-commerce application who does not have any kind of access to the administrative features of the application and the team handling the customer care with access to user's contact information, order history and so on. 

Lidia Identity allows you to create multiple roles and add users to these roles. It is also possible that one user has more than one role.

### Users

Modern applications use membership scenarios very often. Most of the time the requirement as easy as getting the username and/or email address, first name, last name and password during the registration process and saving into the database. The email address and password will be used to sign in users where other data \(for some applications even more data like gender, date of birth etc\) will be used to create user segments for marketing purposes.

Lidia Identity has a large set of out-of-the-box fields for the user data in addition to two extension options, tags and properties.

### Consents

Legal restrictions lately forced us to record explicit consents of users for different types of engagements. To reach out to users by using communication channels such as e-mail and text messages requires marketing consents where processing personal data requires consent of the user especially asked for this purpose. We also have to consider to get separate consents for different legal regions such as Europe \(EU\) and United States even to use cookies. One consent for everything does not work anymore.

Lidia Identity helps you record user consents in a chronological way. We do not use one record for each user and do updates on it, we save every consent-related activity as a new record so we can say exactly at a specific point of time which consents do we have for a specific user.
